SSP is a format I developed for storing many small files in a file.
It can be read by your program by just using SSPReader.vb.

SSP is ideal for you, if:
- the files you want to store are small
- you have thousands of file need to store
- all you want is simple and fast
- your files need to be access by your program very fast

SSP is NOT a replacement for other archive format such as RAR/ZIP...
Because SSP only store a sequence of files, without other things else.
SSP don't support directory, encryption... It don't even remember file name.

This is why it called as Simple Sequence Pack.
